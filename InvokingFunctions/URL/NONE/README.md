```
Your function URL auth type is NONE, but is missing permissions required for public access.
To allow unauthenticated requests, choose the Permissions tab and and create a resource-based policy that grants lambda:invokeFunctionUrl permissions to all principals (*).
Alternatively, you can update your function URL auth type to AWS_IAM to use IAM authentication.
